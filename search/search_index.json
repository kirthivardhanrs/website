This is a more general statement of Kelper's 1st Law which states that the orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the sun at one of the foci. There are 3 (or 4) types of conic sections: circles, ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas. (A circle can be considered a special ellipse) Although this is covered in year 4 math, we will go into conic section with much more detail here. Circles were covered in primary school so we will skip that. Ellipse An ellipse is a plane curve surrounding two focal points (aka focus, plural: foci), such that for all points on the curve, the sum of the two distances to the focal points is a constant. As such, it generalizes a circle, which is the special type of ellipse in which the two focal points are the same. Watch the 3Blue1Brown video below more information about ellipses. Eccentricity We usually represent the semi-major axis as \\(a\\) , semi-minor as \\(b\\) and linear eccentricity (length from center to foci) as \\(c\\) As you hopefully know, for every point on the ellipse, the sum of distances to foci is constant.

It is based on the following equation, which has cemented itself as one of the most iconic ever in recent years. What I have no idea what the above paragraph means but anyways the formula below is very important \\[F_g = G \\frac{Mm}{r^2}\\] Let's first get into the definitions of each of the variables in this equations. The Gravitational Constant, \\(G\\) The Gravitational Constant is pretty much just a constant that scientists measured empirically, that has really no relevance to the solution. The only reason it exists is for calculation, and the value we use isn't necessarily accurate. Empirically determined, \\(G\\) is defined as follows: \\[G = 6.6743015 \\times 10^{-14} \\frac{m^3}{kg \\cdot s^2}\\] Yes, the units are indeed as cancerous as they seem. We usally use a rounded down value of \\(G = 6.67 \\times 10^{-14}\\) in normal mathematical calculations, since beyond this term, the values approach redundancy due to Significant Figure and Negligibility considerations. The Masses of the Objects, \\(M\\) and \\(m\\) Note: Don't waste your time this entire section can summarized as \\(M\\) is an object with bigger mass than \\(m\\) Gravitational Force is dependent of mass, or in this case, the two masses interacting. Picture two objects that are next to each other Those 2 masses experience the same \\(F_g\\) , towards each other. \\(M\\) is usually for describing much bigger mass than \\(m\\) such that only the force on \\(m\\) actually matters. Often, we use \\(M_S\\) or \\(M_\\odot\\) to represent the Mass of the Sun, or the Solar Mass . We also use \\(M_E\\) or \\(M_\\bigoplus\\) to represent the Mass of the Earth. The following is a list of the variables we use for masses, which are usually represented with \\(M\\) since they are traditionally huge masses.

The gravitational field of a mass can be thought of as the region surrounding that mass where another mass will experience a gravitational force. Representing Gravitational Field A common way to represent a gravitational field in a region of space is to use field lines. Gravitational field lines are related to the gravitational field according to: Direction The gravitational field vector \\(\\vec g\\) is tangent to the gravitational field line at each point in space. Magnitude /Field Strength The magnitude of the gravitational field is proportional to the number of field lines per unit area through a surface perpendicular to the lines. Therefore \\(\\vec g\\) is larger when the lines are close together and smaller when they are further apart. The gravitational field in the vicinity of a point mass is always directed towards the mass. The magnitude of the gravitational field is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the point mass.

As they are infinitely far apart we can loosely say that they basically do not interact, so no additional energy is required to keep it in place (note that this can technicaly be any value we choose, its just defined like that). So how do we actually get a value for \\(U\\) for an object \\(r\\) away from the other? Now lets assume we fix 1 object such that it doesn't move for simplicity, and say we are moving the other object towards \\(r\\) . As this object moves towards the other object, it will experience a force and accelerate due to \\(F_g\\) . This will cause its Kinetic energy \\(K\\) to increase, so let's invent a mysterious force \\(F_{mysterious}\\) to counterract \\(F_g\\) at every point in space in just the right way such that \\(F_{net} = 0\\) , (i.e. \\(F_g = -F_{mysterious}\\) ) so there is no net acceleration and Kinetic Energy stays constant. We can now compare the Total Energy \\(TE\\) of the moving object: At \\(r=\\infty\\) we have: \\[\\begin{align*}TE_\\infty &= K + U_\\infty \\\\ &= K + 0\\end{align*}\\] as we defined \\(U_\\infty = 0\\) . And when the object is at distance \\(r\\) from the other object the total energy becomes: \\[TE_r = K + U_r\\] K remains constant as we invoked \\(F_{mysterious}\\) to ensure no net acceleration. We know that \\(F_{mysterious}\\) is clearly putting energy into the system, so we can say that: \\[\\begin{align*}\\Delta TE &= \\text{Work Done by } F_{mysterious} \\\\ &= \\int^r_\\infty F_{mysterious}dr\\end{align*}\\] However we also know: \\[\\begin{align*}\\Delta TE &= TE_r - TE_\\infty \\\\ &= K + U_r - K \\\\ &= U_r\\end{align*}\\] Therefore: \\[\\begin{align*}U_r &= \\int^r_\\infty F_{mysterious}dr \\\\ &= \\int^r_\\infty -F_g dr \\\\ &= \\int^r_\\infty -\\left(-\\frac{GMm}{r^2}\\right) dr \\\\ &= \\int^r_\\infty \\frac{GMm}{r^2} dr \\\\ &= GMm \\int^r_\\infty \\frac{1}{r^2} dr \\\\ &= GMm [-r^{-1}]^r_\\infty \\\\ &= GMm \\left(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{r} \\right) \\\\ U &= -G \\frac{Mm}{r} \\end{align*}\\] A vectorized version of this will be covered sometime later. Warning Most people call this \\(F_{mysterious}\\) as 'force aplied by external agent' OK but why is it negative we define \\(U\\) to be \\(0\\) at infinity Due to attractive nature of gravity , force applied by external agent ( \\(F_{mysterious}\\) ) is directed away from the mass. Work done by external agent/mysterious is negative since the force is opposite in direction to the displacement of the mass m ( \\(\\text{Work done} = Fs\\cos\\theta\\) ) \\(U\\) is a scalar , not a vector, it doesn't have a direction. It just simply means that \\(U_{near} < U_{far}\\) because you need to input energy to move an object to near to far, and that energy gets converted Gravitational Potential Energy, i.e. \\(U_{near} + \\Delta E = U_{far}\\) Question Question Solution The diagram shows 2 points X and Y at distance \\(L\\) and \\(3L\\) respectively, from the center of the earth (of mass \\(M\\) ).

To eliminate dependece on the test mass, we use gravitational potential \\(\\phi\\) . Gravitational Potential \\(\\phi\\) is essentially just \\(U\\) per unit mass, hence you can deduce the formula is: \\[\\phi = \\frac{U_g}{m} = -\\frac{GM}{r}\\] \\(\\phi\\) is also a scalar like \\(U\\) , but unlike \\(U\\) , it does not matter what the test mass is . It is also negative like \\(U\\) . There are a few things to note: Red lines (equipotentials) represent areas where \\(\\phi\\) is constant. There is no work done on an object when moving along an equipotential The closer the equipotential lines, the greater the gravitational field strength \\(g\\) . Since the equipotentials are geting more spaced out the further you go from earth, \\(g\\) decreases with increasing \\(r\\) . The change in potential ( \\(\\Delta\\phi\\) ) or the change in GPE ( \\(\\Delta U\\) ) is independent of the path taken by the object . It only depends on the start and end points . i.e. \\(\\Delta\\phi = \\phi_{endpoint} - \\phi_{startpoint}\\) is true for all paths. (you can also replace \\(\\phi\\) with \\(U\\) ) The minimum work per unit mass to remove an object out of a potential well due to the earth is \\(\\frac{GM}{R_\\oplus}\\) (this is just \\(-U\\) at surface of earth, because \\(U=0\\) means escaping the potential well, which means \\(r\\rightarrow\\infty\\) ) Relationships between \\(F_g\\) , \\(\\frac{dU}{dr}\\) and \\(g\\) , \\(\\frac{d\\phi}{dr}\\) bad color theory in action Consider a mass \\(M\\) fixed in space. Suppose we move a mass m from Point P to P' in the gravitational field of \\(M\\) by applying an external force \\(F_{ext}\\) (you may know this as the \\(F_{mysterious}\\) from earlier) such that there is no change in KE of \\(m\\) . Then: \\(F_{ext} = -F_g\\) We also know that \\(\\text{Work Done} = \\Delta U\\) .

As they are infinitely far apart we can loosely say that they basically do not interact, so no additional energy is required to keep it in place (note that this can technicaly be any value we choose, its just defined like that). So how do we actually get a value for \\(U\\) for an object \\(r\\) away from the other? Now lets assume we fix 1 object such that it doesn't move for simplicity, and say we are moving the other object towards \\(r\\) . As this object moves towards the other object, it will experience a force and accelerate due to \\(F_g\\) . This will cause its Kinetic energy \\(K\\) to increase, so let's invent a mysterious force \\(F_{mysterious}\\) to counterract \\(F_g\\) at every point in space in just the right way such that \\(F_{net} = 0\\) , (i.e. \\(F_g = -F_{mysterious}\\) ) so there is no net acceleration and Kinetic Energy stays constant. We can now compare the Total Energy \\(TE\\) of the moving object: At \\(r=\\infty\\) we have: \\[\\begin{align*}TE_\\infty &= K + U_\\infty \\\\ &= K + 0\\end{align*}\\] as we defined \\(U_\\infty = 0\\) . And when the object is at distance \\(r\\) from the other object the total energy becomes: \\[TE_r = K + U_r\\] K remains constant as we invoked \\(F_{mysterious}\\) to ensure no net acceleration.

Warning Most people call this \\(F_{mysterious}\\) as 'force aplied by external agent' OK but why is it negative we define \\(U\\) to be \\(0\\) at infinity Due to attractive nature of gravity , force applied by external agent ( \\(F_{mysterious}\\) ) is directed away from the mass.

In reality, however, planets are not exactly points. Shell theorem is, however, a great excuse for people to use point masses as representing objects in space. Specifically, it states that: Shell theorem A spherically symmetric body affects external objects gravitationally as though all of its mass were concentrated at a point at its center. If the body is a spherically symmetric shell (i.e., a hollow ball), no net gravitational force is exerted by the shell on any object inside, regardless of the object's location within the shell. Point mass isn't (as much of) a scam Of course, the earth, sun, moon and most spherical-ish astronomical objects are not perfect spheres, however this serves as a good enough approximation for our calculations. The point mass approximation fails not because the objects aren't a point but rather because it deviates from spherical symmetry . What's more, the further you are from a mass, the less it matters how much it deviates from spherical symmetry. Gravity inside a hollow shell Point 2 is interesting because when you are inside a spherical shell, even if you are off-center, the net gravitational force is \\(0\\) . You can think of it intuitively as the masses on the left is closer to you, resulting in greater attraction to the left, but there are more mass to the right of you, such that they cancel out perfectly. Gravity inside the earth Another interesting fact is that if we assume the earth has uniform density , the gravitational force inside earth varies linearly with distance from the center. This is because we can effectively discard the shell above the point due to point 2. Let the density of the earth be \\(\\rho\\) : \\[\\begin{align*}F_g &= G\\frac{Mm}{r^2} \\\\ &= Gm\\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\rho}{r^2} \\\\ &= \\frac{4}{3}Gm\\pi\\rho r \\\\ \\therefore F_g &\\propto r\\end{align*}\\] And hence: We can combined this with the inverse square law to give the following graph: Of course, in reality this doesn't happen as the earth is not of uniform density. This is mainly because the earth's crust is less dense than the core, and the earth's mass is not uniformly spread out. Another thing to note is that earth is not actually a sphere, but is somewhat ellipsoidal, so at the poles you are closer to the center of the earth and experience greater \\(g\\) Extension: Proof of shell theorem Hold on, why can we just assume that a point mass works just because is spherically symmetric? And how do the forces inside a hollow shell so perfectly cancel out? You don't need to know this If you haven't learn integration or aren't familiar with applying it, it is fine if you skip the proof. The proof is rather advanced compared to what is currently covered, so as long as you get the gist of the previous section you are fine. This proof has three steps: find gravitational force caused by a ring find gravitational force caused by a shell find gravitational force caused by the sphere/thick shell Finding gravitational force caused by a ring Finding the gravitational force caused by a ring, which is part of a shell of radius R. d is the distance of the object to the center of mass of the sphere that we care about. \\(\\theta\\) is the angle to the ring. ( \\(0\\leq\\theta\\leq\\pi\\) , if you are inside the sphere) We can start by getting the gravitational force from a single point: \\[F_g = \\frac{GmM_{point}}{x^2}\\] Since the ring is circular, the \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) -components of \\(F_g\\) cancel out, and we only care about the force in the \\(x\\) -direction. We get: \\[F_{ring} = \\frac{GmM_{ring}}{x^2}\\cos\\alpha\\] Finding gravitational force caused by a shell However, as it turns out this ring is actually infinitely thin with infinitesimal mass so we have to use differentials instead: \\[dF = \\frac{Gm\\cdot dm}{x^2\\cos\\alpha\\] We can now integrate it to get the gravitational force caused by a shell: \\[\\begin{align*}F_{shell} &= \\int dF\\\\&=\\int\\frac{Gm\\cos\\alpha}{x^2}dm \\end{align*}\\] Now the hard part is finding \\(dm\\) , because not all rings have the same mass (because they will not all have the same size) Finding the mass of a ring The mass of a ring can be given as such: \\[m_{ring} = \\rho V_{ring}\\] now we need to find the volume of an infinitesimal ring: \\[\\begin{align*}V_{ring} &= circumference \\cdot thickness \\cdot arc length \\\\ &= 2\\pi R' \\cdot t \\cdot R d\\theta \\\\ &= 2\\pi R \\sin\\theta tR \\cdot d\\theta\\end{align*}\\] (since \\(R'= R\\sin\\theta\\) ) Therefore we can get the mass of a ring: \\[\\begin{align*}m_{ring} &= \\rho V_{ring} \\\\ &= \\rho 2\\pi R \\sin\\theta tR d\\theta \\\\ &= 2\\pi t \\rho R^2 \\sin\\theta d \\theta\\end{align*}\\] Finding the total mass of a shell We can do this by simply integrating \\(m_{ring}\\) : \\[\\begin{align*}m_{shell} &= \\int_{0}^{\\pi} 2\\pi t \\rho R^2 \\sin\\theta d \\theta \\\\ &= 2\\pi t\\rho R^2 \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin\\theta d\\theta\\\\&= 2\\pi t\\rho R^2 \\left[-\\cos\\theta\\right]_{0}^{\\pi} \\\\ &= 2\\pi t\\rho R^2 (-\\cos\\pi + \\cos 0)\\\\ &= 4\\pi t\\rho R^2\\end{align*}\\] the bounds are \\(0\\) and \\(\\pi\\) because \\(0\\leq\\theta\\leq\\pi\\) . Back to the force from the shell \\[\\begin{align*}F_{shell} &= \\int dF\\\\ &= \\int \\frac{Gm}{x^2} \\cos\\alpha dm \\\\ &= \\int\\frac{Gm}{x^2} \\cos\\alpha 2\\pi t \\rho R^2 \\sin\\theta d \\theta \\\\ &= 2 \\pi t\\rho R^2Gm\\int \\frac{\\cos\\alpha \\sin\\theta}{x^2} d\\theta\\end{align*}\\] This is still a mess. We need to get rid of the \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\theta\\) somehow. We can get \\(\\cos\\alpha\\) by using: \\[\\begin{align*}\\cos\\alpha &= \\frac{Adj}{Hyp} \\\\ &= \\frac{d-R\\cos\\theta}{x}\\end{align*}\\] We can also use the cosine rule \\(c^2 = a^2+b^2-2ab \\cos C\\) : \\[\\begin{align*}x^2 &= d^2 +R^2 - 2dR\\cos\\theta \\\\ -R\\cos\\theta&=\\frac{x^2-d^2-R^2}{2d}\\end{align*}\\] we can plug this back: \\[\\begin{align*}\\cos\\alpha &= \\frac{d-R\\cos\\theta}{x} \\\\ &= \\frac{d+\\frac{x^2-d^2-R^2}{2d}}{x} \\\\ &= \\frac{\\frac{2d^2}{2d}+\\frac{x^2-d^2-R^2}{2d}}{x} \\\\ &= \\frac{\\frac{2d^2+x^2-d^2-R^2}{2d}}{x} \\\\ &= \\frac{d^2+x^2-R^2}{2d\\cdot x} \\end{align*}\\] now \\(\\cos\\alpha\\) is only in terms of x! Now to deal with \\(\\sin\\theta d\\theta\\) we do implicit differentiation: \\[\\begin{align*}-R\\cos\\theta&=\\frac{x^2-d^2-R^2}{2d} \\\\ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(-R\\cos\\theta\\right) &= \\frac{d}{dx} \\frac{x^2-d^2-R^2}{2d} \\\\ \\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\left(-R\\cos\\theta\\right) \\frac{d\\theta}{dx} &= \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(\\frac{1}{2d}x^2-\\frac{d^2-R^2}{2d}\\right) \\\\ R\\sin\\theta \\frac{d\\theta}{dx} &= \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(\\frac{1}{2d}x^2\\right)-\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{d^2-R^2}{2d}\\right) \\\\ R\\sin\\theta \\frac{d\\theta}{dx} &= \\frac{2x}{2d} + 0 \\\\ R\\sin\\theta d\\theta &= \\frac{x}{d} dx \\\\ \\sin\\theta d\\theta &= \\frac{x}{Rd} dx\\end{align*}\\] And finally back to \\(F_{shell}\\) : \\[\\begin{align*}F_{shell} &= 2 \\pi t\\rho R^2Gm\\int \\frac{\\cos\\alpha \\sin\\theta}{x^2} d\\theta \\\\ &= 2 \\pi t\\rho R^2Gm\\int x^-2\\frac{d^2+x^2-R^2}{2d\\cdot x} \\frac{x}{Rd} dx \\\\ &= 2\\pi t\\rho R^2Gm\\int \\frac{d^2+x^2-R^2}{2d^2 R x^2} dx \\\\ &= \\frac{2\\pi t\\rho R^2Gm}{2d^2 R}\\int\\frac{d^2+x^2-R^2}{x^2} dx \\\\ &= \\frac{\\pi t\\rho RGm}{d^2}\\int\\left(\\frac{d^2-R^2}{x^2}+1\\right) dx \\end{align*}\\] Ok hold up, what are the bounds for this? Well, x must be in the range between the distance to the closest point of the sphere \\(d-R\\) or the furthest point of the sphere \\(d+R\\) , so can use those as the bounds: \\[\\begin{align*}F_{shell} &= \\frac{\\pi t\\rho RGm}{d^2}\\int_{d-R}^{d+R}\\left((d^2-R^2)\\frac{1}{x^2}+1\\right) dx \\\\ &= \\frac{\\pi t\\rho RGm}{d^2}\\left[\\frac{R^2-d^2}{x}+x\\right]_{d-R}^{d+R} \\\\ &= \\frac{\\pi t\\rho RGm}{d^2}\\left[\\frac{(R-d)(R+d)}{d+R}+d+R-\\frac{(R-d)(R+d)}{d-R}-(d-R)\\right] \\\\ &= \\frac{\\pi t\\rho RGm}{d^2}[R-d+R+d+d+R-d+R] \\\\ &= \\frac{\\pi t\\rho RGm}{d^2}[4R] \\\\ &= \\frac{(4\\pi t\\rho R^2)Gm}{d^2} \\\\ &= \\frac{(m_{shell})Gm}{d^2}\\end{align*}\\] Finding gravitational force caused by a sphere since \\(F_{shell} = \\frac{Gmm_{shell}}{d^2}\\) , and spheres are made of concentric shells, we can just say (I don't think you want more integration) that: \\[F_{sphere} = \\frac{Gmm_{sphere}}{d^2}\\] After all this work, we finally prove 1. of Shell theorem to be true - we can indeed represented spherically symmetric as point masses. Proving there is no gravity inside a hollow shell Thankfully, all we need to do is to use different bounds when integrating the force from a shell. When we are inside the shell, the nearest point is \\(R-d\\) instead, and the furthest point is still \\(d+R\\) \\[\\begin{align*} F &= \\frac{\\pi t\\rho RGm}{d^2}\\left[\\frac{R^2-d^2}{x}+x\\right]_{R-d}^{d+R} \\end{align*}\\] you can indeed verify that this is 0. Since a thick hollow sphere is just many concentric shells, adding together many \\(0\\) s still results in a \\(0\\) net force.","title":"Shell theorem"},{"location":"celestial/gravitation/shell_theorem/#shell-theorem","text":"So far we have been dealing with point masses.

We can still use numerical methods, which won't be shown here. But we can always get a solution if we try hard enough (read: approximate enough things). So, it turns out we can solve this if we assume \\(M_2<<M_1\\) . Sometimes, this is a valid assumption, for example, in the case of Earth-Sun.

The positions of these places are best explained qualitatively, and it is not done in the same way as for \\(L_1\\) , \\(L_2\\) and \\(L_3\\) , which is why they were discovered seperately by different people. \\(L_4\\) and \\(L_5\\) form an equilateral triangle with both masses. Because of this, the gravitational forces are still in the same ratio as the masses of the bodies, and so the resultant force points towards the centre of mass (barycenter) of the system. This is an incredibly important result because the barycenter is the centre of rotation, and this is precisely what allows \\(L_4\\) and \\(L_5\\) to be in orbital equilibrium, orbiting with the same angular velocity as the other Lagrange points. For those interested \\(L_4\\) and \\(L_5\\) were actually discovered by Lagrange when he was working on a solution to the infamous three-body problem. Turns out, the problem actually has a solution when we take the mass of the third body to be really small compared to the other 2 masses. Graphical intuition If you aren't satisfied enough with the above dull results, perhaps a graph will help. On the line that passes through both masses, we can equate the centripetal force to the net gravitational force and obtain this expression for the radial acceleration: \\[a = -\\frac{GM_1}{r^2}sgn(r)+\\frac{GM_2}{(R-r)^2}sgn(R-r)+\\frac{G((M_1+M_2)r-M_2 R)}{R^3}\\] where \\(sgn(x)=\\frac{x}{|x|}\\) . We can hence plot \\(a\\) against \\(r\\) and obtain the below graph: Net radial acceleration of a point orbiting along the Sun-Earth line The intersections at zero represent the first three Lagrange points. The qualitative trend of the graphs is very helpful to remember as well. Applications If you are wondering, if these Lagrange points are so good at maintaining orbital equilibrium, why doesn't NASA just put its satellites there? The thing is, they do. The recently launched James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) orbits the Sun-Earth system at \\(L_2\\) !

This is an incredibly important result because the barycenter is the centre of rotation, and this is precisely what allows \\(L_4\\) and \\(L_5\\) to be in orbital equilibrium, orbiting with the same angular velocity as the other Lagrange points. For those interested \\(L_4\\) and \\(L_5\\) were actually discovered by Lagrange when he was working on a solution to the infamous three-body problem.

Introduction From Kepler's 1st Law, we know that orbits are ellipses and mathematically we can represent the general equation for said ellipse in polar coordinates as such: \\[r=\\frac{p}{1+\\varepsilon\\cos\\theta}\\] From here, we can get the general shape or trajectory of an orbit, which is well, an ellipse, but we want to rewrite this general equation in the context of a particle in orbit. Getting the equation A usual way (the only way) of tackling problems like these, is just write down all the equations we know, manipulate them, and hope we get what we want, so that is exactly what we will do. The net force on the particle in orbit is the gravitational force since it is the only force acting on it, so it follows from Newton's laws that: \\[m\\vec a=- G \\frac{Mm}{r^2} \\hat r \\] \\[\\vec a = - G \\frac{M}{r^2} \\hat r\\] Since we have this expression, we can now introduce \\(\\vec L\\) to these expressions: \\[\\vec a \\times \\vec L = - G \\frac{M}{r^2} \\hat r \\times \\vec L\\] From here, we have one important observation to note, that being as follows: \\[\\begin{align*}\\frac{d}{dt} \\left(\\vec v \\times \\vec L\\right) &= \\dot{\\vec{v}} \\times \\vec L + \\vec v \\times \\dot{\\vec{L}} \\\\ &= \\vec a \\times \\vec L\\end{align*}\\] since \\(\\vec{L}\\) is conserved (remains constant), \\(\\dot{\\vec{L}} = 0\\) and since we have the following: \\[\\vec a \\times \\left(\\vec b \\times \\vec c \\right) = (\\vec a \\cdot \\vec c)\\vec b - (\\vec a \\cdot \\vec b) \\vec c\\] Proof of \\(\\vec a \\times \\left(\\vec b \\times \\vec c \\right) = (\\vec a \\cdot \\vec c)\\vec b - (\\vec a \\cdot \\vec b) \\vec c\\) \\[\\begin{align*}\\vec a \\times \\left(\\vec b \\times \\vec c \\right) &= \\begin{pmatrix}a_x \\\\ a_y \\\\ a_z \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\left(\\begin{pmatrix}b_x \\\\ b_y \\\\ b_z \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix}c_x \\\\ c_y \\\\ c_z \\end{pmatrix} \\right)\\\\ &= \\begin{pmatrix}a_x \\\\ a_y \\\\ a_z \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix}b_yc_z - b_z c_y \\\\ b_zc_x - b_xc_z \\\\ b_xc_y - b_yc_x \\end{pmatrix} \\\\ &= \\begin{pmatrix}a_y(b_xc_y - b_yc_x) - a_z(b_zc_x - b_xc_z) \\\\ a_z(b_yc_z - b_z c_y) - a_x(b_xc_y - b_yc_x) \\\\ a_x(b_zc_x - b_xc_z) - a_y(b_yc_z - b_z c_y) \\end{pmatrix}\\\\ &= \\begin{pmatrix}(a_yc_y + a_zc_z)b_x - (a_yb_y + a_zb_z)c_x \\\\ (a_xc_x + a_zc_z)b_y - (a_xb_x + a_zb_z)c_y \\\\ (a_xc_x + a_yc_y)b_z - (a_xb_x + a_yb_y)c_z\\end{pmatrix}\\\\ &= \\begin{pmatrix}(a_xc_x + a_yc_y + a_zc_z)b_x - (a_xb_x + a_yb_y + a_zb_z)c_x \\\\ (a_xc_x + a_yc_y a_zc_z)b_y - (a_xb_x + a_yb_y + a_zb_z)c_y \\\\ (a_xc_x + a_yc_y + a_zc_z)b_z - (a_xb_x + a_yb_y + a_zb_z)c_z\\end{pmatrix}\\\\ &= \\begin{pmatrix}(\\vec a \\cdot \\vec c)b_x - (\\vec a \\cdot \\vec b)c_x \\\\ (\\vec a \\cdot \\vec c)b_y - (\\vec a \\cdot \\vec b)c_y \\\\ (\\vec a \\cdot \\vec c)b_z - (\\vec a \\cdot \\vec b)c_z\\end{pmatrix}\\\\&=(\\vec a \\cdot \\vec c)\\vec b - (\\vec a \\cdot \\vec b) \\vec c\\end{align*}\\] We get the following as well: \\[\\begin{align*}\\frac{d}{dt} \\left(\\vec v \\times \\vec L\\right) &= \\vec a \\times \\vec L \\\\ &=- G \\frac{M}{r^2} \\hat r \\times \\vec L \\\\ &= - G \\frac{Mm}{r^3} \\vec r \\times (\\vec r \\times \\vec v) \\\\ &= \\frac{-GMm}{r^3} \\left[ (\\vec r \\cdot \\vec v) \\vec r -(r^2)\\vec v\\right] \\\\ &= \\frac{GMm}{r^3} \\left[(r^2)\\vec v - (rv) \\vec r\\right]\\end{align*}\\] We now observe something else as well: \\[\\begin{align*}\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{GMm}{r} \\vec r \\right) &= GMm \\frac{\\vec v r - \\vec r v}{r^2} \\\\ &= \\frac{GMm}{r^3} \\left[\\vec v (r^2) - \\vec r (vr) \\right]\\end{align*}\\] From here, we are able to determine the following equality: \\[\\frac{d}{dt} \\left(\\vec v \\times \\vec L\\right) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{GMm}{r} \\vec r \\right)\\] Which also yields the following result: \\[\\vec v \\times \\vec L = \\frac{GMm}{r} \\vec r + GMm \\vec C\\] Wherein \\(GMm\\vec{C}\\) is a constant vector of integration that lies in the plane of motion of \\(m\\) . Now, using the same triple product result from above: \\[\\begin{align*}\\vec{v}\\times\\vec{L}&=\\vec{v}\\times(\\vec{r}\\times\\vec{v}) \\\\ &= (\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{v})\\vec{r}-(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{r})\\vec{v}\\\\&=v^2\\vec{r} - (\\vec v \\cdot \\vec r)\\vec v\\end{align*}\\] we get the following: \\[v^2\\vec{r} - (\\vec v \\cdot \\vec r)\\vec v = \\frac{GM}{r} \\vec r + GM \\vec C\\] From here, we let \\(\\alpha\\) denote the angle between \\(v\\) and \\(r\\) . Thus we get: \\[v^2\\vec{r} - (vr\\cos\\alpha)\\vec v = \\frac{GM}{r} \\vec r + GM \\vec C\\] Finally we take the dot product with \\(\\vec r\\) on both sides of the equation. \\[(vr)^2 - (vr\\cos\\alpha)(\\vec r \\cdot \\vec v) = GMr + GM \\vec r \\cdot \\vec C\\] Similarly, we can resolve the dot products, and introduce \\(\\theta\\) as the angle between \\(\\vec r\\) and \\(\\vec C\\) . \\[(vr)^2 - (vr)^2\\cos^2\\alpha = GMr + GMrC \\cos\\theta\\] From here, we use the trigonometric identity to get: \\[\\frac{L^2}{m^2} = (vr)^2\\sin^2\\alpha = GMr(1+C \\cos\\theta)\\] From here, we can continue to represent \\(r\\) in terms of \\(L\\) , \\(m\\) , \\(G\\) , \\(M\\) , \\(C\\) and \\(\\theta\\) : \\[r = \\frac{L^2}{GMm^2(1+C\\cos\\theta)}\\] This is a standard form to describe the trajectory of \\(m\\) , and we can conclude that \\(\\vec C\\) depicts this thing known as the eccentricity vector , \\(e\\hat{e}\\) , which is a completely new concept I haven't introduced. We will get to it soon. Computing Eccentricity However, one way to compute \\(e\\) now is to do the following: \\[e = \\sec\\theta \\left( \\frac {L^2}{GMm^2r} - 1 \\right)\\] Since this \\(e\\) is simply the instantaneous eccentricity vector magnitude, we conclude that the actualy eccentricity, \\(\\epsilon\\) is when \\(\\theta = 0\\) . Hence, we have that: \\[\\epsilon = \\left(\\frac{L^2}{GMm^2r} - 1\\right)\\] From here, we square both sides in the hopes that we will get something a lot more helpful: \\[\\epsilon^2 = \\left(\\frac{L^4}{G^2M^2m^4r^2} + 1 - \\frac{2L^2}{GMm^2r}\\right)\\] Welll... that didn't help. Except it did. We note that \\(L^2 = m^2r^2v^2\\) , assuming \\(\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) , hence we are able to substitute in some locations this very value: \\[\\epsilon^2 = \\left(\\frac{L^2m^2r^2v^2}{G^2M^2m^4r^2} + 1 - \\frac{2L^2}{GMm^2r}\\right)\\] Welp. So now we can try eliminating whatever values we can remove, and we get now that: \\[\\epsilon^2 = \\left(\\frac{L^2v^2}{(GMm)^2} + 1 - \\frac{2L^2}{GMm^2r}\\right)\\] To make this better, let's try extracting \\(\\frac{2L^2}{(GMm)^2}\\) from the above expression: \\[\\epsilon^2 = \\left(1 + \\frac{2L^2}{(GMm)^2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}v^2 - \\frac{GM}{r}\\right)\\right)\\] Now, we introduce \\(m\\) into the inner expression: \\[\\epsilon^2 = \\left(1 + \\frac{2L^2}{(GMm)^2 m} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r}\\right)\\right)\\] And notice that we got the expression for Total Energy, \\(E\\) back! Now we can substitute that in, and get a more decent result: \\[\\epsilon = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2EL^2}{(GMm^2)m}}\\] This is a much better way of depicting the eccentricity, \\(\\epsilon\\) . This is also a pretty important result whcih can help us map the trajectory of a particle. Orbit Patterns The Circular Orbit This should ideally be a no-brainer. Circular Orbits are simply orbits with \\(\\epsilon = 0\\) , hence we get the following: \\[\\frac{2EL^2}{(GMm)^2m} = -1\\] Hence, we can express \\(E\\) as follows: \\[E = \\frac{-(GMm)^2m}{2L^2}\\] We have previously noted the following result too: \\[r = \\frac{L^2}{GMm^2}\\] From here, we get that: \\[E = \\frac{-GMm}{2r}\\] This is in fact a general result, and from here we equate the two definitions of \\(E\\) found: \\[E = -\\frac{GMm}{2r} = K - \\frac{GMm}{r}\\] Moving this around, we get the following result: \\[K = \\frac{GMm}{2r} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\] This can help us get orbital speed, \\(v\\) , at radius \\(r\\) . \\[v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}\\] This can also help us get the escape velocity, using a parabolic trajectory instead. The Parabolic Orbit In a parabolic trajectory, \\(\\epsilon = 1\\) , which means that \\[\\frac{2EL^2}{(GMm)^2m} = 0\\] Here, we note that \\(L \\ne 0\\) , since it is physically impossible in any orbit. This means that the total energy, \\(E = 0\\) , which also means the following: \\[K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = G\\frac{Mm}{r}\\] From here, we can represent the new orbital speed, \\(v\\) as: \\[v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}\\] This is in fact the escape velocity of an orbit, since the object moves to an infinitely far away point after this. This is due to the fact that having \\(E = 0\\) means that there cannot be a bounding effect on the mass anymore. The Elliptical Orbit Alright, so this is the main part of this entire article. We note that \\(\\epsilon\\) does not have a specific value in the case of an elliptical orbit, since \\(\\epsilon\\) follows the following formula, based on the semi-major axis, \\(a\\) and semi-minor axis, \\(b\\) : \\[\\epsilon = \\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)^2}\\] And this ratio, \\(\\frac{b}{a}\\) has infinite possibilities. This effectively means that \\(0 \\lt \\epsilon \\lt 1\\) , which opens up a whole range of values. But since we have another representation of \\(\\epsilon\\) , we are able to get a clearer value. Firstly, we note that \\[0 \\lt \\epsilon \\lt 1 \\implies 0 \\lt \\epsilon^2 \\lt 1\\] From here, we have that: \\[0 \\lt 1 + \\frac{2EL^2}{(GMm)^2m} \\lt 1\\] Since we know that: \\[r = \\frac{L^2}{GMm^2}\\] This means that: \\[-1 \\lt \\frac{2Er}{GMm} \\lt 0\\] Moving along this forumla, we get: \\[-\\frac{GMm}{2r} \\lt E \\lt 0\\] Based on what we have gotten for the the parabolic and circular trajectories, this means that: \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}} < v < \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}\\] One can aslo find the velocity as a function of radial distance for elliptical orbits. This is by acknowledging that \\(E\\) still follows the same description, that is to say that: \\[E = K + U = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r}\\] We note that due to the concept of a central force, the total energy is conserved about the orbit, hence at any points \\(q\\) and \\(r\\) , \\(E_q = E_r\\) . Considering the locations where the \\(\\vec r\\) and \\(\\vec v\\) vectors are orthogonal to one another, we arrive at the apoapsis and the periapsis, two points located along the major axis of the ellipse. At these locations, we not that \\(\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}2\\) , which means that \\(L = mrv\\) , which is conserved along these two positions. Hence, we have that \\(r_pv_p = r_av_a\\) , where \\(a\\) is the apoapsis and \\(p\\) is the periapsis. From here we have the following: \\[\\frac{1}{2} mv_a^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r_a} = \\frac{1}{2} mv_p^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r_p}\\] Remember that we can remove \\(m\\) , which can help us simplify the expression to this: \\[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(v_a^2-v_p^2\\right) = GM\\left(\\frac1{r_a}-\\frac1{r_p}\\right)\\] Yeah, that is helpful. Anyways, we go on to introduce the representation we previously restablised, in a slightly different light: \\[v_a^2 = 2GM \\frac{r_p-r_a}{r_ar_p}\\frac{1}{\\left(1-\\frac{r_a^2}{r_p^2}\\right)}=2GM \\frac{r_p}{r_a(r_a+r_p)}\\] Luckily for us, we know that \\(r_a+r_p=2a\\) , so we can use that to our disposal: \\[v_a^2 = GM \\frac{2a-r_a}{ar_a} = GM \\left(\\frac{2}{r_a} - \\frac{1}{a} \\right)\\] From here, we can get a general expression for the \"specific energy\", as shown below: \\[\\frac{2E}{m} = v^2 - \\frac{2GM}{r} = GM \\left(\\frac{2}{r_a} - \\frac{1}{2a} \\right) - \\frac{2GM}{r_a} = -\\frac{GM}{a}\\] Expressing \\(v^2\\) in terms of the relevant quantities, we get the following famous equation: \\[v^2 = GM \\left(\\frac{2}{r} - \\frac{1}{a}\\right)\\] This is the vis-viva equation, commonly used to describe the velocity of an object in elliptical motion. This formula can be used for many tasks, like computing velocity in an elliptical orbit and more. The point is that it is quite ingenious but also just as torturous. Hence, use it with care.","title":"The Trajectory of a Particle in Orbit"},{"location":"celestial/mechanics/trajectory_of_particle/#the-trajectory-of-a-particle-in-orbit","text":"Warning In order to prevent potential permanent trauma please read through the \"Conic Sections\" page first and only then will this section make sense.","title":"The Trajectory of a Particle in Orbit"},{"location":"celestial/mechanics/trajectory_of_particle/#introduction","text":"From Kepler's 1st Law, we know that orbits are ellipses and mathematically we can represent the general equation for said ellipse in polar coordinates as such: \\[r=\\frac{p}{1+\\varepsilon\\cos\\theta}\\] From here, we can get the general shape or trajectory of an orbit, which is well, an ellipse, but we want to rewrite this general equation in the context of a particle in orbit.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"celestial/mechanics/trajectory_of_particle/#getting-the-equation","text":"A usual way (the only way) of tackling problems like these, is just write down all the equations we know, manipulate them, and hope we get what we want, so that is exactly what we will do.

Circular Orbits are simply orbits with \\(\\epsilon = 0\\) , hence we get the following: \\[\\frac{2EL^2}{(GMm)^2m} = -1\\] Hence, we can express \\(E\\) as follows: \\[E = \\frac{-(GMm)^2m}{2L^2}\\] We have previously noted the following result too: \\[r = \\frac{L^2}{GMm^2}\\] From here, we get that: \\[E = \\frac{-GMm}{2r}\\] This is in fact a general result, and from here we equate the two definitions of \\(E\\) found: \\[E = -\\frac{GMm}{2r} = K - \\frac{GMm}{r}\\] Moving this around, we get the following result: \\[K = \\frac{GMm}{2r} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\] This can help us get orbital speed, \\(v\\) , at radius \\(r\\) . \\[v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}\\] This can also help us get the escape velocity, using a parabolic trajectory instead.","title":"The Circular Orbit"},{"location":"celestial/mechanics/trajectory_of_particle/#the-parabolic-orbit","text":"In a parabolic trajectory, \\(\\epsilon = 1\\) , which means that \\[\\frac{2EL^2}{(GMm)^2m} = 0\\] Here, we note that \\(L \\ne 0\\) , since it is physically impossible in any orbit.

This is due to the fact that having \\(E = 0\\) means that there cannot be a bounding effect on the mass anymore.","title":"The Parabolic Orbit"},{"location":"celestial/mechanics/trajectory_of_particle/#the-elliptical-orbit","text":"Alright, so this is the main part of this entire article. We note that \\(\\epsilon\\) does not have a specific value in the case of an elliptical orbit, since \\(\\epsilon\\) follows the following formula, based on the semi-major axis, \\(a\\) and semi-minor axis, \\(b\\) : \\[\\epsilon = \\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)^2}\\] And this ratio, \\(\\frac{b}{a}\\) has infinite possibilities. This effectively means that \\(0 \\lt \\epsilon \\lt 1\\) , which opens up a whole range of values. But since we have another representation of \\(\\epsilon\\) , we are able to get a clearer value. Firstly, we note that \\[0 \\lt \\epsilon \\lt 1 \\implies 0 \\lt \\epsilon^2 \\lt 1\\] From here, we have that: \\[0 \\lt 1 + \\frac{2EL^2}{(GMm)^2m} \\lt 1\\] Since we know that: \\[r = \\frac{L^2}{GMm^2}\\] This means that: \\[-1 \\lt \\frac{2Er}{GMm} \\lt 0\\] Moving along this forumla, we get: \\[-\\frac{GMm}{2r} \\lt E \\lt 0\\] Based on what we have gotten for the the parabolic and circular trajectories, this means that: \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}} < v < \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}\\] One can aslo find the velocity as a function of radial distance for elliptical orbits. This is by acknowledging that \\(E\\) still follows the same description, that is to say that: \\[E = K + U = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r}\\] We note that due to the concept of a central force, the total energy is conserved about the orbit, hence at any points \\(q\\) and \\(r\\) , \\(E_q = E_r\\) . Considering the locations where the \\(\\vec r\\) and \\(\\vec v\\) vectors are orthogonal to one another, we arrive at the apoapsis and the periapsis, two points located along the major axis of the ellipse. At these locations, we not that \\(\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}2\\) , which means that \\(L = mrv\\) , which is conserved along these two positions. Hence, we have that \\(r_pv_p = r_av_a\\) , where \\(a\\) is the apoapsis and \\(p\\) is the periapsis. From here we have the following: \\[\\frac{1}{2} mv_a^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r_a} = \\frac{1}{2} mv_p^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r_p}\\] Remember that we can remove \\(m\\) , which can help us simplify the expression to this: \\[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(v_a^2-v_p^2\\right) = GM\\left(\\frac1{r_a}-\\frac1{r_p}\\right)\\] Yeah, that is helpful. Anyways, we go on to introduce the representation we previously restablised, in a slightly different light: \\[v_a^2 = 2GM \\frac{r_p-r_a}{r_ar_p}\\frac{1}{\\left(1-\\frac{r_a^2}{r_p^2}\\right)}=2GM \\frac{r_p}{r_a(r_a+r_p)}\\] Luckily for us, we know that \\(r_a+r_p=2a\\) , so we can use that to our disposal: \\[v_a^2 = GM \\frac{2a-r_a}{ar_a} = GM \\left(\\frac{2}{r_a} - \\frac{1}{a} \\right)\\] From here, we can get a general expression for the \"specific energy\", as shown below: \\[\\frac{2E}{m} = v^2 - \\frac{2GM}{r} = GM \\left(\\frac{2}{r_a} - \\frac{1}{2a} \\right) - \\frac{2GM}{r_a} = -\\frac{GM}{a}\\] Expressing \\(v^2\\) in terms of the relevant quantities, we get the following famous equation: \\[v^2 = GM \\left(\\frac{2}{r} - \\frac{1}{a}\\right)\\] This is the vis-viva equation, commonly used to describe the velocity of an object in elliptical motion. This formula can be used for many tasks, like computing velocity in an elliptical orbit and more. The point is that it is quite ingenious but also just as torturous. Hence, use it with care.","title":"The Elliptical Orbit"},{"location":"meteorology/","text":"Getting Started In Singapore, light pollution outshines all but the brightest stars, and other astronomical objects are often blocked by clouds.

They are often classified by how high above the ground their base is. Low Clouds Low clouds are usually composed of water droplets, though cumulonimbus clouds include ice crystals, and have a base below 2 km. Stratus Stratus clouds are low, grey clouds that typically form in sheets or layers, often obscuring the tops of tall buildings. In Singapore, shallow fog or mist often forms in forested areas during the night. At daybreak, the mist lifts to form patches of stratus gradually rising above the ground. Ragged patches of stratus, called stratus fractus, can also form beneath rain clouds. This is often seen here during periods of prolonged rain experienced in the Northeast Monsoon. Cumulus Cumulus clouds are easily recognisable fluffy white clouds usually on a sunny day. They are formed via thermal convection when heat from the ground warms the air up and causes them to rise. Cumulus clouds can combine together and form clouds with deeper convection. Such clouds can evolve into Cumulus congestus , a towering cumulus cloud. Those may continue to grow into Cumulonimbus clouds. Stratocumulus These clouds can be thought of as a combination of Stratus and Cumulus clouds. These often look like a greyish or white sheet with rolls or clumps, which is a sign of weak convection. These are often found over large areas of the ocean. Cumulonimbus These clouds are responsible for the thunderstorms you experience in Singapore. Althought these are \"Low Clouds\" (due to having a low base), these clouds extend up high into the Troposphere, which in the tropics is about 15 kilometers high. Cumulonimbus with its anvil-shaped top sheared by higher level winds You can think of cumulonimbus as a better vesion of cumulus. However, the defining feature that separates cumulonimbus from cumulus congestus is the presence of ice crystals at the top of the cloud. You can tell when a cumulus congestus becomes a cumulonimbus when its top appears to be more \"frayed out\" and fibrous rather than looking like a cauliflower. These clouds only last about one hour most of the time, but under certain conditions some cumulonimbus clouds manage to regen. Medium Clouds Medium clouds are usually composed of water droplets or a mixture of water droplets and ice crystals, and have a base of between 2 km and 7 km. Altostratus Altostratus clouds are pretty boring clouds that cover a decent chunk of the sky, and may even be thick enought to block out the sun. Optical phenomeno like iridescence can also be observed through thin altostratus. In the tropics altostratus clouds usually form from the remnants of convective weather systems (e.g. thunderstorms) that have since dissipated. Altocumulus Altocumulus consists of rounded, individual masses with clear sky showing between them. In the tropics they also usually come from dead convective weather systems (e.g. thunderstorms). The difference between altocumulus and altostratus is that in altocumulus, some instability is present such that weak convection takes place, giving rise to individual convective cells. Nimbostratus This is a multi-level cloud that is formed usually in the mid-latitudes, and is very rare in Singapore, so you can ignore it. It is formed when a mass of warm air is moving into a mass of cold air (warm front), which does not happen in Singapore because there is no cold air [citation needed]. It is placed in Medium Clouds because it generally starts forming in this height range and spreads upwards and downwards. Although this cloud is non-convective it is capable of producing rain, ice pellets or snow. It is basically very thick altostratus that rains. High Clouds High clouds are made of ice crystals, as it is colder the higher you go up, and often have a base somewhere between 5.5 - 14 kilometers above the ground. Cirrus Cirrus clouds are clouds that are mainly made out of ice crystals. They often look like a feather or a wisp. In the tropics, cirrus are often formed from dead thunderstorms - the anvil of a cumulonimbus cloud is effectively large shield of cirrus. Since upper level winds are usually strong, these cirrus cloud tops are often carried far downwind from the thunderstorm. Large, thick patches of cirrus often last far longer than the parent cumulonimbus cloud. Precipitation from cirrus clouds never reaches the ground as the ice crystals falling down often melt and evaporate away long before they can reach the ground Cirrostratus This cloud is very thin and often hard to notice, despite it being rather common. It is also made of ice crystals, and can often make the sky look \"milky\" Cirrocumulus Cirrocumulus consists of many small cloud elements, which are shaped like tufts and ripples. Like all other high-altitude clouds, it is mainly made out of ice crystals. However, cirrocumulus also contains some supercooled water. When that freezes of it becomes cirrostratus.

Most thunderstorms are associated with cumulonimbus clouds. Formation Cumulonimbus clouds normally form on warm, sunny days. Solar radiation heats the earth\u2019s surface during the day, which in turn warms the lowest layer of air. As the warm and humid air rises, it cools and condenses to form clouds, which grow larger and larger as more warm air rises. Not all cumulonimbus clouds bring thunderstorms; some just bring moderate to heavy showers. On average, an individual cumulonimbus cloud takes about an hour to grow and dissipate, and produces less than thirty minutes of thunder and lightning. If a thunderstorm lasts longer than this, it is probably because there is more than one cumulonimbus cloud present. Thunderstorms occur all year round in Singapore, but are more prevalent during the inter-monsoon periods (April-May and October-November). Phenomena Thunderstorms often bring heavy rains and strong winds, as well as lightning and thunder. They are also capable of producing microbursts, hail and waterspouts. Lightning Lightning is a large electrical spark of very short duration during a thunderstorm. Inside a thunderstorm cloud, an enormous electrical charge slowly builds up; the charge is then discharged in a blinding flash, as lightning zig-zags between ground and cloud. There are three types of lightning: intra-cloud lightning, inter-cloud lightning, and cloud-to-ground lightning. Intra-cloud lightning is the most common while inter-cloud lightning is the least common. The most dangerous type, cloud-to-ground lightning, makes up about 20% of all lightning. Inter-cloud lightning is often a precursor to cloud-to-ground lightning. The highest incidence of lightning activity typically occurs in November followed by April and May. These are the Inter-Monsoon months when the predominantly light and variable winds favour the development of localised and intense thunderstorms. On average, the Inter-Monsoon months account for more than 50% of the lightning strokes in a year. cloud-to-cloud lightning (Changi Meteorological Station) Most lightning strokes occur within 5-6 km of a thunderstorm cloud. In the absence of a thunderstorm in a location, lightning strokes from a distant thunderstorm cloud more than 10 km away could still affect that location. Such a lightning strike is known as a \u201cbolt from the blue\u201d. Such lightning strikes are likely from the anvil to the cloud to the ground. cloud-to-ground lightning (Pasir Ris) Thunder is the sharp or rumbling sound which accompanies lightning. It is caused by the intense heating and expansion of the air along the path of the lightning. The rumble of thunder is caused by the noise passing through layers of the atmosphere at different temperatures. Microburst Rain falling from a thunderstorm cloud can drag the surrounding air downwards to produce a downdraft. This downdraft in turn spreads out upon reaching the ground, resulting in gusty winds that can cause damage to the surrounding area if the downdraft is intense and strong. A microburst is an intense downdraft that occurs over a small localized area, typically with a horizontal extent of less than 4 km. They have a brief lifespan reaching maximum intensity within 10 minutes, and can generate wind speeds of more than 270km/h. Schematic of a microburst with its characteristic \u201ccurling of air\u201d upon strong impact with the ground. Ignore the airplane. As a microburst is a small scale feature that forms and dissipates very quickly, it remains a challenge to forecast when a microburst will occur, and to issue timely warnings of its expected occurrence. This is often a danger to airplanes but we are not YFC so we do not care. Hail Hail stones form in an intense thunderstorm (cumulonimbus) cloud when raindrops freeze at high levels and then grow steadily in size as they are recycled through powerful updrafts and downdrafts, or strong vertical winds. They compose of transparent irregular ice pieces or alternating layers of ice, ranging in size from a few millimetres to a few centimetres in diameter. Once a hailstone becomes too heavy to be supported by the thunderstorm\u2019s updraft, it falls out of the cloud. hail from an intense thunderstorm event in 2013 In the tropics, the atmosphere is often warmer with the freezing level usually at altitudes greater than 5 km. Therefore, hail formed in the upper atmosphere usually melts before reaching the ground. However, it is still possible for hail to form under particularly strong updrafts of intense thunderstorms, with the updrafts carrying and sustaining the growth of hail high up in the atmosphere. Correspondingly strong downdrafts help to drive the hail down to the ground before it has completely melted. Sightings of hail stones have been reported in Singapore every few years on average. Hailstones that reach the ground here tend to be small compared to those formed in the mid-latitudes. Waterspouts A waterspout is a rotating column of air often associated with intense thunderstorms over the sea. They are like tornados but over sea and weaker. They are also called \"funnel clouds\" and they usually have a diameter of 50m. It might look like the thunderstorm is sucking up water, but it's actualy just water droplets in a rotating vortex of air that is rising. As the air rises it cools and condenses making it visible. It on average lasts about 10 minutes, but some bigger ones can last up to 1 hour. They tend to move at around 30 km/h, and pretty much die as soon as they get near the coast. At sea they can put swimmers and small boats at risk but apart from that they can't do much damage. Sumatra Squall A Sumatra squall is an organised line of thunderstorms that originate over Sumatra Island or the Strait of Malacca, and typically move eastward towards Singapore and the surrounding region under the influence of southwesterly or westerly winds. It commonly occurs during the Southwest Monsoon and Inter-monsoon periods, and usually affects Singapore overnight or in the morning. A Sumatra squall is often characterised by a sudden onset of strong gusty surface winds of 40 to 80km/h and heavy rain lasting from 1 to 2 hours as it moves across the island. Maximum gusts (sudden increses of wind speed) of up to 93 km/h have been recorded during the passage of a Sumatra squall. Radar animation of a Sumatra squall affecting Singapore in the predawn hours Monsoon Surge During the northern hemisphere winter (December \u2013 March), high pressure systems frequently develop over continental northern Asia, and bring dry conditions and cold subsiding air over the northern Asian landmass. At times, a sudden increase in wind speed causes the cold subsiding air to surge southwards into the South China Sea towards low pressure systems in the southern Hemisphere. This sudden surge of cold air is referred to as a Northeast Monsoon surge. As the cold winds surge southwards over the South China Sea, it warms and gathers moisture, leading to the formation of dense rain clouds over the equatorial region. On occasions when the winds are particularly strong, they can bring moderate to heavy showers/rain and occasional thunderstorms to coastal regions in Southeast Asia such as Vietnam, Peninsular Malaysia, and Singapore. The showers can be continuous and prolonged, lasting from 2 to several days. The Northeast Monsoon Surges occur more often and are more intense during the early part of the Northeast Monsoon season (November \u2013 January) than in the latter half of the season (February - March). Surges that occur during the dry phase of the Northeast Monsoon typically bring strong winds but there are no accompanying showers. On average, Singapore experiences 2 to 4 monsoon surges each year. Each event can last between 1 and 5 days where widespread continuous moderate to heavy rain affects the island. Sometimes the surges come in spells with breaks of cloudy or overcast conditions.

It is caused by the intense heating and expansion of the air along the path of the lightning. The rumble of thunder is caused by the noise passing through layers of the atmosphere at different temperatures.","title":"Lightning"},{"location":"meteorology/basics/weather_systems/#microburst","text":"Rain falling from a thunderstorm cloud can drag the surrounding air downwards to produce a downdraft. This downdraft in turn spreads out upon reaching the ground, resulting in gusty winds that can cause damage to the surrounding area if the downdraft is intense and strong. A microburst is an intense downdraft that occurs over a small localized area, typically with a horizontal extent of less than 4 km. They have a brief lifespan reaching maximum intensity within 10 minutes, and can generate wind speeds of more than 270km/h. Schematic of a microburst with its characteristic \u201ccurling of air\u201d upon strong impact with the ground. Ignore the airplane. As a microburst is a small scale feature that forms and dissipates very quickly, it remains a challenge to forecast when a microburst will occur, and to issue timely warnings of its expected occurrence. This is often a danger to airplanes but we are not YFC so we do not care.","title":"Microburst"},{"location":"meteorology/basics/weather_systems/#hail","text":"Hail stones form in an intense thunderstorm (cumulonimbus) cloud when raindrops freeze at high levels and then grow steadily in size as they are recycled through powerful updrafts and downdrafts, or strong vertical winds. They compose of transparent irregular ice pieces or alternating layers of ice, ranging in size from a few millimetres to a few centimetres in diameter. Once a hailstone becomes too heavy to be supported by the thunderstorm\u2019s updraft, it falls out of the cloud. hail from an intense thunderstorm event in 2013 In the tropics, the atmosphere is often warmer with the freezing level usually at altitudes greater than 5 km. Therefore, hail formed in the upper atmosphere usually melts before reaching the ground. However, it is still possible for hail to form under particularly strong updrafts of intense thunderstorms, with the updrafts carrying and sustaining the growth of hail high up in the atmosphere. Correspondingly strong downdrafts help to drive the hail down to the ground before it has completely melted. Sightings of hail stones have been reported in Singapore every few years on average. Hailstones that reach the ground here tend to be small compared to those formed in the mid-latitudes.","title":"Hail"},{"location":"meteorology/basics/weather_systems/#waterspouts","text":"A waterspout is a rotating column of air often associated with intense thunderstorms over the sea.

It on average lasts about 10 minutes, but some bigger ones can last up to 1 hour. They tend to move at around 30 km/h, and pretty much die as soon as they get near the coast.

At times, a sudden increase in wind speed causes the cold subsiding air to surge southwards into the South China Sea towards low pressure systems in the southern Hemisphere. This sudden surge of cold air is referred to as a Northeast Monsoon surge. As the cold winds surge southwards over the South China Sea, it warms and gathers moisture, leading to the formation of dense rain clouds over the equatorial region. On occasions when the winds are particularly strong, they can bring moderate to heavy showers/rain and occasional thunderstorms to coastal regions in Southeast Asia such as Vietnam, Peninsular Malaysia, and Singapore. The showers can be continuous and prolonged, lasting from 2 to several days. The Northeast Monsoon Surges occur more often and are more intense during the early part of the Northeast Monsoon season (November \u2013 January) than in the latter half of the season (February - March). Surges that occur during the dry phase of the Northeast Monsoon typically bring strong winds but there are no accompanying showers. On average, Singapore experiences 2 to 4 monsoon surges each year. Each event can last between 1 and 5 days where widespread continuous moderate to heavy rain affects the island. Sometimes the surges come in spells with breaks of cloudy or overcast conditions.

Ultraviolet Catastrophe It is the turn of the 20th century. At this point, physicists had proved without a shadow of a doubt that light was a wave. This is done via the double slit experiment which was carried out by Thomas Young in 1801. The Problem The spectrum of light emitted by a perfect blackbody. However, when physicists tried to predict the radiation coming from a blackbody under the assumption that light was a wave, obtained an equation now known as the Rayleigh-Jeans Law. At high frequencies, it predicted that the power emitted by a blackbody would tend to infinity as the frequency increased. This clearly did not match up with experimental results which showed that there was a peak wavelength of radiation that a blackbody would emit. This was the ultraviolet catastrophe, called as such since the experimental results deviated significantly at ultraviolet wavelengths. Solution In 1900, Max Planck heuristically derived the correct form for the intensity spectral distribution function by making some strange (for the time) assumptions. In particular, Planck assumed that electromagnetic radiation can be emitted or absorbed only in discrete packets, called quanta, of energy: \\(E_{\\text{quanta}}=h\\nu =h{\\frac {c}{\\lambda }}\\) , where \\(h\\) is Planck's constant, \\(\\nu\\) is the frequency of light, \\(c\\) is the speed of light and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of light. Planck's assumptions led to the correct form of the spectral emission intensity function: \\[ E_\\lambda=\\frac {2hc^2}{\\lambda^5} \\cdot \\left(e^{\\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_BT}}-1\\right)^{-1} \\] This formula provide the emission intensity in form \\(E_\\lambda\\) which signifies a wavelength-dependant variable, but this variable is also affected by changes in \\(T\\) , i.e. Temperature. Here, \\(k_B\\) is simply Boltzmann's Constant, often standardised as: \\[\\begin{align*}k_B &= 1.3806504 \\times 10^{-23} \\cdot J/K \\\\&\\approx 1.38065 \\times 10^{-23} \\cdot J/K\\end{align*}\\] Another way to determine \\(k_B\\) is by representing it as a fraction of the Ideal Gas Constant, \\(R\\) as depicted below: \\[\\begin{align*}R &= 8.314462618 \\cdot J/mol\\cdot K \\\\&\\approx 8.314 \\cdot J/mol\\cdot K \\\\&\\approx 0.08206 \\cdot \\frac{L \\cdot atm}{mol \\cdot K}\\end{align*}\\] with Avogadro's constant, subject of his very famous formula, which we all learnt back in Y1, as shown below: \\[\\begin{align*}N_A &= 6.02214076 \\times 10^{23} \\cdot mol^{-1} \\\\&\\approx 6.02 \\times 10^{23} \\cdot mol^{-1}\\end{align*}\\] Hence we get the following: \\[\\begin{align*}k_B &= \\frac{R}{N_A} \\\\&= 1.380648999974554 \\times 10^{-23} \\cdot J/K \\\\&\\approx 1.38065 \\times 10^{-23} \\cdot J/K\\end{align*}\\] And we use this value to our benefit. Albert Einstein (in 1905) and Satyendra Nath Bose (in 1924) solved the problem by postulating that Planck's quanta were real physical particles \u2013 what we now call photons, not just a mathematical fiction. They modified statistical mechanics in the style of Boltzmann to an ensemble of photons. Einstein's photon had an energy proportional to its frequency. This published postulate was specifically cited by the Nobel Prize in Physics committee in their decision to award the prize for 1921 to Einstein. Wien's Displacement Law Wien\u2019s displacement formula gives the wavelength that a blackbody radiate which releases the highest spectral emission intensity. The following shows the formula: \\[ \\lambda_{max} = \\frac{b}{T} \\approx\\frac{0.002898 \\cdot mK}{T} \\] where \\(T\\) is the temperature of the surface of the star (from which radiation is emitted). The constant \\(b \\approx 0.002898 \\cdot mK\\) is known as Wien\u2019s Wavelength Displacement Constant . Derivation This formula can be derived by maximising the emission intensity, \\(E_\\lambda\\) as per Planck's aformentioned law. Since we aim to determine the maximum wavelength, we essentially let \\(T\\) be constant while differentiating by \\(\\lambda\\) . This is essentially a partial differentiation action, and we use \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\lambda}\\) , as we depicted below. \\[\\frac{\\partial E_\\lambda}{\\partial \\lambda} = 2hc^2 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\lambda} \\left(\\frac {1}{\\lambda^5} \\cdot \\left(e^{\\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_BT}}-1\\right)^{-1} \\right) = 0\\] We compute the differential as follows: \\[\\left(e^{\\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_BT}-1}\\right)^{-1} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\lambda}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda^5}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\lambda^5}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\lambda}\\left(\\left(e^{\\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_BT}}-1\\right)^{-1} \\right) = 0\\] As you can see, this is torture. We hence try to kinda simplify it (this isn't going to work, is it?): \\[-5\\left(\\lambda^6 e^{\\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_BT}-1}\\right)^{-1} - \\lambda^{-5} \\left( e^{\\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_B T}}-1\\right)^{-2} e^{\\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_B T}}\\] Now say you experimentally sample the intensity of a blackbody at many different wavelengths. If you do this for all wavelengths, you will get Planck\u2019s distribution, the maximum of which can be found using Wien\u2019s displacement formula. Different stars have different surface temperatures, which give different blackbody distributions with different peak wavelengths. This explains why hotter stars appear blue \u2013 their peak wavelengths are the shortest. Of course, it\u2019s not just blue light that is reaching us: the star only appears blue because that is the dominant form of visible light that is reaching us. The same applies for reddish, cooler stars.","title":"Wien's Displacement Law"},{"location":"optics/blackbody/wiens_displacement_law/#wiens-displacement-law","text":"Before learning about Wien's Displacement Law, we need to understand its history.","title":"Wien's Displacement Law"},{"location":"optics/blackbody/wiens_displacement_law/#ultraviolet-catastrophe","text":"It is the turn of the 20th century.

This clearly did not match up with experimental results which showed that there was a peak wavelength of radiation that a blackbody would emit. This was the ultraviolet catastrophe, called as such since the experimental results deviated significantly at ultraviolet wavelengths.","title":"The Problem"},{"location":"optics/blackbody/wiens_displacement_law/#solution","text":"In 1900, Max Planck heuristically derived the correct form for the intensity spectral distribution function by making some strange (for the time) assumptions. In particular, Planck assumed that electromagnetic radiation can be emitted or absorbed only in discrete packets, called quanta, of energy: \\(E_{\\text{quanta}}=h\\nu =h{\\frac {c}{\\lambda }}\\) , where \\(h\\) is Planck's constant, \\(\\nu\\) is the frequency of light, \\(c\\) is the speed of light and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of light. Planck's assumptions led to the correct form of the spectral emission intensity function: \\[ E_\\lambda=\\frac {2hc^2}{\\lambda^5} \\cdot \\left(e^{\\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_BT}}-1\\right)^{-1} \\] This formula provide the emission intensity in form \\(E_\\lambda\\) which signifies a wavelength-dependant variable, but this variable is also affected by changes in \\(T\\) , i.e. Temperature. Here, \\(k_B\\) is simply Boltzmann's Constant, often standardised as: \\[\\begin{align*}k_B &= 1.3806504 \\times 10^{-23} \\cdot J/K \\\\&\\approx 1.38065 \\times 10^{-23} \\cdot J/K\\end{align*}\\] Another way to determine \\(k_B\\) is by representing it as a fraction of the Ideal Gas Constant, \\(R\\) as depicted below: \\[\\begin{align*}R &= 8.314462618 \\cdot J/mol\\cdot K \\\\&\\approx 8.314 \\cdot J/mol\\cdot K \\\\&\\approx 0.08206 \\cdot \\frac{L \\cdot atm}{mol \\cdot K}\\end{align*}\\] with Avogadro's constant, subject of his very famous formula, which we all learnt back in Y1, as shown below: \\[\\begin{align*}N_A &= 6.02214076 \\times 10^{23} \\cdot mol^{-1} \\\\&\\approx 6.02 \\times 10^{23} \\cdot mol^{-1}\\end{align*}\\] Hence we get the following: \\[\\begin{align*}k_B &= \\frac{R}{N_A} \\\\&= 1.380648999974554 \\times 10^{-23} \\cdot J/K \\\\&\\approx 1.38065 \\times 10^{-23} \\cdot J/K\\end{align*}\\] And we use this value to our benefit. Albert Einstein (in 1905) and Satyendra Nath Bose (in 1924) solved the problem by postulating that Planck's quanta were real physical particles \u2013 what we now call photons, not just a mathematical fiction. They modified statistical mechanics in the style of Boltzmann to an ensemble of photons. Einstein's photon had an energy proportional to its frequency. This published postulate was specifically cited by the Nobel Prize in Physics committee in their decision to award the prize for 1921 to Einstein.","title":"Solution"},{"location":"optics/blackbody/wiens_displacement_law/#wiens-displacement-law_1","text":"Wien\u2019s displacement formula gives the wavelength that a blackbody radiate which releases the highest spectral emission intensity.

If you do this for all wavelengths, you will get Planck\u2019s distribution, the maximum of which can be found using Wien\u2019s displacement formula.

This explains why hotter stars appear blue \u2013 their peak wavelengths are the shortest. Of course, it\u2019s not just blue light that is reaching us: the star only appears blue because that is the dominant form of visible light that is reaching us. The same applies for reddish, cooler stars.","title":"Derivation"},{"location":"optics/magnitude/apparent_absolute_magnitude/","text":"Apparent and Absolute Magnitude Magnitude Scales are quite important for measuring not just brightness, but distance as well. Whether this be from Earth or otherwise, it stands that Magnitudes are incredibly important tools to have in your toolbox. But what is a magnitude? Magnitudes are generally used to classify and compare different objects in space that either emit light or reflect it. Planets and especially Stars are often compared using the Magnitude scales. According to ancient astronomers, especially the Chinese astronomers back in the day, brightness was in fact proportional to size, which meant that a brighter star would be way larger in a geocentric model than a smaller star. This, however, is not the case, since Magnitudes are also affected by Distance, and Luminosity is unfortunaely not proportional. In ancient Greece, around the time a simple handyman named Jesus started preaching about a different god than those the pagans believed, an ancient astronomer by the name of Hipparchus decided to try classifying every star in the sky into 6 relevant categories. He decided to go with the following demarkation: The Brightest, most luminous stars were the \"Stars of the First Magnitude\" The Unclear, those barely visible to the naked eye, stars were the \"Stars of the Sixth Magnitude\" However the problem that rose from this system was that it was highly arbitrary and subjective, since Hipparchus did all the measurements by himself without consulting for help. Pogson Norman Pogson was an astrophysicist at the prestigious Oxford University back in 1856 when he came with a solution to the magnitude scaling problem. He proferred a solution that used a logarithmic scale rather than a linear scale. Since detectors were actually present back then, Pogson was able to come to a unique scale system: each factor of difference in magnitude denoted \\(100^{\\frac{1}{5}} \\approx 2.512\\) as a change of luminosity. That is to say, a star of magnitude +4.00 was \\(2.512\\) times as bright as a star of magnitude +5.00, or rather, a star of magnitude +0.00 was a 100 times a bright that of magnitude +5.00. At that point Polaris was used a reference point, since it had a good old nice value of \\(m = +2.00\\) . However, a few years later, it was discovered that Polaris is a variable star. That meant that it's magnitude was not a constant, and it changed at some points. After this, the astronomical community decided to use Vega as a reference point, since it had a nice magnitude of \\(m = +0.00\\) , or after a few minor corrections, \\(m = +0.026\\) . This came to a head when, in recent years, Vega was also found to be variable. However the astronomical community has yet to decide what object they want to use next.

This law is applicable in calculations such as: Comparing the brightness of the sun and the moon Question Solution Calculate how many times brighter the sun is as comapred to the moon (use the table above) Since we know that the Sun's Apparent Magnitude is -26.7, and the Full Moon's Apparent Magnitude is -12.9, we can apply it to the formula below: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{F_\\bigodot}{F_{moon}} &= 10^{\\frac{2}{5} \\left(-12.9 - (-26.7) \\right)} \\\\ &= 10^{\\frac{2}{5}\\left(13.8\\right)} \\\\ &\\approx 10^6 = 1 000 000 \\end{align*}\\] By this, we note that the sun is a million times brighter than the moon in the Earth sky. However, this only allows us to compare apparent magnitudes, and not actualy get a value for them.

Hence we can derive the following equation: \\[ m - M = 5log\\left(\\frac{d}{10 pc}\\right) \\] \\(pc\\) in this case is a parsec which is \\(3.086 \\times 10^{16}m\\) or \\(3.262\\) light years. \\(m - M\\) is also known as the distance modulus , since it only depends on the distance to the star Dazzling Supernovae SPHL 2021 Problem 32 Solution A type-1A supernova has an absolute magnitude of \\(M = \u221219.3\\) .

However in reality, the space between stars contains some interstellar medium. This causes some of the radiation to be absorbed (and perhaps re-emitted at a different wavelength), or scattered away from the line of sight. All of these radiation loses are called extinction . Here we have a star radiating flux (i.e. light) \\(L_0\\) into a region (more formally, a solid angle \\(\\omega\\) ) in some wavelength range (Extinction rates are different for different wavelengths). Since the medium absorbs and scatters radiation, the total light (flux) into the region \\(L\\) will now decrease with increasing distance \\(r\\) . From \\(r\\) to \\(r+dr\\) , the amount of light drops from \\(L\\) to \\(L+dL\\) ( \\(dL\\leq0\\) ).

In nuclear fusion, nuclei are fused together to form heavier elements, generating energy in the process. The amount of energy released in nuclear fusion is much greater than that of chemical burning or gravitational collapse, giving the Sun\u2019s lifetime of around 10 billion years. There are three main types of nuclear fusion that occur in stars. Depending on the mass of the star, different types of fusion will be dominant in the core of the star. Proton-Proton Chain The first is the proton-proton (PP) chain, which fuses hydrogen into helium. This reaction begins at around 6 million K and usually occurs in stars of one solar mass or below. It is the primary energy source of our Sun. There are other rarer reaction pathways that involve the heavier elements, but for clarity\u2019s sake, below is the one that converts hydrogen directly into helium. Keeping in mind that hydrogen and other elements in stars exist as plasma rather than atoms, the fusion of hydrogen will involve fusing 2 protons (nuclei of hydrogen) together. Considering the immense repulsion (also known as the Coulomb barrier between like charges at such small distances, it seems impossible that fusion can even occur. In fact, it was initially calculated that temperatures in the sun were a thousand times too low for protons to have enough energy to overcome this barrier. However, it is clear that the sun must be capable of fusing hydrogen, since we are all not dead. To explain this very apparent discrepancy, we shall turn to quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, every particle has both wave-like and particle-like characteristics. This leads to the Heisenburg Uncertainity Principle, which states that a limit to which we can be sure of a particle's position and momentum. Thus, particles can \"tunnel\" through potential barriers, allowing them to exist in places classically impermissible. Thus, a very minute number of protons will actually \"tunnel\" through the Coulomb barrier and react with each other. Note There are other PP chains, like PP chain II and III, which produces approximately 16-17% and 0.02% of helium-4, respectively Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen (CNO) Cycle This cycle involves elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, and is dominant in stars slightly heavier than the sun at around 1.3 solar masses. Of course, this PP chain still operates alongside this cycle in the star, but the CNO cycle is relatively faster. As you can see, the carbon-12 nucleus is regenerated, and four hydrogen atoms are indirectly converted into helium at the end. This means that the carbon-12 nucleus is in fact a catalyst. Triple Alpha Process The triple alpha process requires alot of energy and thus, occurs largely in higher mass stars and red giants. You can see why. Here we combine 3 helium-4 nuclei to form a carbon-12 nucleus, releasing energy in the process. The repulsion and thus the Coulomb barrier, is stronger because we are effectively fusing helium which has a higher charge. The temperature needs to be much higher to supply enough energy for this reaction to take place fast enough. Energy Production In nuclear physics, the mass of atoms are given in atomic mass units (or u for short). The carbon-12 atom is defined to be exactly 12 u in mass, and so a hydrogen atom, or one proton, is around \\(1 u\\) in mass. A proton by itself (i.e. a hydrogen nucleus) actually has a mass of \\(1.007276466812 u\\) , for reasons that you will see. In the PP chain, where four hydrogen nuclei (protons) are converted into one helium nucleus (2 proton, 2 neutrons), the sum of masses of the four protons is 0.7% larger than the mass of one helium nucleus. This mass defect is actually converted to energy according to \\(E = m c^2\\) in the PP chain.

This means that at the centre of the star there is a great pressure since there is more stuff compressing the core. As we all know, more pressure means that things get hotter. Thus, it is at the core, where the temperature of the star is the highest. Now, we all know that nuclear fusion needs a high temperature to occur. After all, why would scientists want cold fusion if it happened at room temperature? Given the core has the highest temperature in the entire star, it is logical that it is the location where nuclear fusion occurs. Now that we know how energy in the star is made. How is it produced? Let us find out. Note The subsequent analysis of the radiative zone and convective zone is done with respect to a sun-like star. Depending on the mass of the star, the radiative zone can be the inside or outside layer of the star. The Radiative Zone On its journey out, energy in the form of photons first enters the radiative zone. As the name suggests, radiation is the main form of energy transfer here \u2013 though not quite the form that you would expect! Keeping in mind that the stars are very dense, photons don\u2019t travel straight through. Rather, they travel in a zigzag manner. This zigzag motion is caused by the photons \"bouncing\" around within this dense layer. Note that this layer of plasma is so hot that it is fully ionized (all electrons are stripped from atoms to form nuclei), so the constituent particles interact strongly with light. Overall, due to the sheer density of the radiative zone, a photon takes a few million years to reach the edge of the radiative zone from the core. This is in spite of the fact that photons travel at the speed of light. This bouncing also gradually causes the photon to lose energy over time, and its wavelength will decrease, causing it to fall from the gamma range to the visible-UV range in the electromagnetic spectrum. Conditions for Energy Transfer via Radiation Energy transfer by radiation occurs when there is a low temperature gradient and low enough opacity to allow energy transfer by radiation. It also requires a high temperature as the hydrogen atoms need to be ionised for the star to be transparent to ultraviolet radiation. The Convective Zone At this point, temperatures are sufficiently low for electrons and atomic nuclei to recombine and form atoms. These atoms will then absorb the photons and heat up. Thus, the plasma at the bottom of the convective zone is hotter and less dense. As a result, it rises while the cooler plasma (which is denser) sinks. This setups up convection currents which are visible to the naked eye (see the picture of convection cells on the sun's surface). When the plasma reaches the surface of the star, its energy is released as heat. Conditions for Energy Transfer via Convection Energy transfer by convection occurs when there is a large temperature gradient a given parcel of gas within the star will continue to rise if it rises slightly via an adiabatic process. Different Mass Stars Different mass stars have different orders of layers (see above). Click on the tabs below to see why. \\(M\\) < \\(0.5 M_\\odot\\) \\(0.5 M_\\odot\\) < \\(M\\) < \\(1.5 M_\\odot\\) \\(M\\) > \\(1.5 M_\\odot\\) Stars with masses less than 0.5 solar masses do not have a radiative zone and only have a convective zone. This is because the temperature in these low mass stars is low enough such that the hydrogen is largely neutral and thus opaque to UV photons. Thus, energy transfer is dominated by convection. Stars with masses between 0.5 and 1.5 solar masses have a radiative zone on the inside and a convective zone on the outside. In these stars, hydrogen-to-helium fusion occurs primarily via proton\u2013proton chains, which do not establish a steep temperature gradient. Thus, radiation dominates in the inner portion of solar mass stars. The outer portion of solar mass stars is cool enough that hydrogen is neutral and thus opaque to ultraviolet photons, so convection dominates. Therefore, solar mass stars have radiative cores with convective envelopes in the outer portion of the star. Stars with masses above 1.5 solar masses have a convective zone on the inside and a radiative zone on the outside. In these stars, the core temperature much higher, so hydrogen-to-helium fusion occurs primarily via the CNO cycle. Due to the strong temperature sensitivity of the CNO cycle, the temperature gradient in the inner portion of the star is steep enough to make the core convective. In the outer portion of the star, the temperature gradient is shallower but the temperature is high enough that the hydrogen is nearly fully ionized, so the star remains transparent to ultraviolet radiation. Thus, massive stars have a radiative envelope.","title":"Structure of a Star"},{"location":"stellar/basics/star_structure/#structure-of-a-star","text":"","title":"Structure of a Star"},{"location":"stellar/basics/star_structure/#the-core","text":"Recall that a star is constantly under pressure due to gravity compressing it.

This setups up convection currents which are visible to the naked eye (see the picture of convection cells on the sun's surface). When the plasma reaches the surface of the star, its energy is released as heat. Conditions for Energy Transfer via Convection Energy transfer by convection occurs when there is a large temperature gradient a given parcel of gas within the star will continue to rise if it rises slightly via an adiabatic process.","title":"The Convective Zone"},{"location":"stellar/basics/star_structure/#different-mass-stars","text":"Different mass stars have different orders of layers (see above).

This is because the temperature in these low mass stars is low enough such that the hydrogen is largely neutral and thus opaque to UV photons. Thus, energy transfer is dominated by convection. Stars with masses between 0.5 and 1.5 solar masses have a radiative zone on the inside and a convective zone on the outside. In these stars, hydrogen-to-helium fusion occurs primarily via proton\u2013proton chains, which do not establish a steep temperature gradient. Thus, radiation dominates in the inner portion of solar mass stars. The outer portion of solar mass stars is cool enough that hydrogen is neutral and thus opaque to ultraviolet photons, so convection dominates. Therefore, solar mass stars have radiative cores with convective envelopes in the outer portion of the star. Stars with masses above 1.5 solar masses have a convective zone on the inside and a radiative zone on the outside. In these stars, the core temperature much higher, so hydrogen-to-helium fusion occurs primarily via the CNO cycle. Due to the strong temperature sensitivity of the CNO cycle, the temperature gradient in the inner portion of the star is steep enough to make the core convective. In the outer portion of the star, the temperature gradient is shallower but the temperature is high enough that the hydrogen is nearly fully ionized, so the star remains transparent to ultraviolet radiation. Thus, massive stars have a radiative envelope.","title":"Different Mass Stars"},{"location":"stellar/classification/classification/","text":"Classification of Stars Not all stars are like our sun (if you need a reminder).

High-mass stars evolve much faster than their low-mass counterparts. The more massive a star, the faster it consumes fuel and the shorter its main-sequence lifespan becomes. For example, the sun has a lifespan of around 10 billion years, but a \\(5M_\\odot\\) B-type star only lasts 100 million years. A \\(10M_\\odot\\) O-type star will die in only 20 million years. Changes happen much faster in general because high-mass stars' stronger gravity generates more heat, which speeds up all phases of stellar evolution. Leaving the main sequence High-mass stars will run out of hydrogen in their cores and leave the main sequence far sooner than the sun. At first it is similar like the sun, an inert helium core surrounded by a hydrogen burning shell. ZAMS = Z ero A ge M ain S equence The above image shows Helium-burning evolutionary tracks, following on from the hydrogen-burning phase shown in above figure. The cyan (red if light mode) lines show the hydrogen-burning phase, and the orange (blue if light mode) lines show the helium-burning phase. In stars with \\(M\\leq2.5M_\\bigodot\\) , helium is ignited in a degenerate core, and the star moves back down from the top of its red-giant track to the red-giant clump halfway up the track (hollow circle). In stars with \\(2.5M_\\bigodot \\leq M \\leq 9M_\\bigodot\\) , the core is not degenerate when helium ignites, and these stars move blueward (i.e. to the left) in the H\u2013R diagram, but move redward again (i.e. to the right) once core-helium burning is replaced by shell-helium burning. This path is called a blue loop . In stars with \\(M>9M_\\bigodot\\) , helium ignites when the star is still close to the main sequence and does not interrupt its redward evolution. No Helium Flash? As covered earlier White dwarf or Supernova? The \"common\" separating line between high-mass stars and low-mass stars is around \\(8M_\\odot\\) . Stars below this mass limit never reach the 600 million K required to fuse carbon nuclei, so it becomes a white dwarf made of Carbon and Oxygen (or maybe Neon and Oxygen). A high mass star, however, can fuse not just Hydrogen and Helium, but Carbon, Neon, and even heavier elements Helium Burning In high-mass stars, evolution is so fast that the star doesn't even reach the re-giant region before it starts fusing Helium. As each element is burned to depletion at the center, the core contracts and heats up, and fusion starts again. A new inner core forms, contracts again, heats again, and so on. The star\u2019s evolutionary track continues smoothly across the supergiant region of the H\u2013R diagram, seemingly unaffected by each new phase of burning. The star\u2019s radius increases as its surface temperature drops, so the star swells to become a red supergiant. As the star fuses heavier and heavier elements, the total number of nuclei decreases, which means there is less nuclei to fuse, reducing the amount of time spent on the stage. the number of protons in the nucleus increases, and as a result the repulsion between nuclei increases, requiring more energy to fuse nuclei. heavier nuclei are more stable, so fusing them releases less energy than lighter nuclei, so the star has to go through more nuclei faster. Put all three together and each stage gets much shorter than the last. Carbon Burning fun fact Betelgeuse is estimated to be at this stage right now. Carbon Burning essentially allows to carbon nuclei to form a few products such as: \\(^{12}\\text{C} + \\!^{12}\\text{C} \\rightarrow \\!^{24}\\text{Mg}\\) \\(^{12}\\text{C} + \\!^{12}\\text{C} \\rightarrow \\!^{23}\\text{Mg} + \\!^1\\text{n}\\) \\(^{12}\\text{C} + \\!^{12}\\text{C} \\rightarrow \\!^{23}\\text{Na} + \\!^1\\text{H}\\) \\(^{12}\\text{C} + \\!^{12}\\text{C} \\rightarrow \\!^{20}\\text{Ne} + \\!^4\\text{He}\\) \\(^{12}\\text{C} + \\!^{12}\\text{C} \\rightarrow \\!^{16}\\text{O} + 2\\,^4\\text{He}\\) This builds up an Oxygen-Neon-Magnesium core. Carbon Burning is inefficient, not just because of nucleide stability but also because a large fraction of energy is radiated away as neutrinoes, that do not provided any radiation pressure to support the gravity of the star. Intermediate-mass Stars For stars whose mass lie within \\(4\\) to \\(8M_\\odot\\) , this is about all they will do. After approximately 1000 years of carbon burning, the inert core consists of O/Ne/Mg. The core contracts and heats up, and creates unstable shell burning. This leads to large thermal pulses that destabilize the envelope of the star. This star is known as a Cepheid Variable . Eventually they eject their envelopes like our sun, giving us a planetary nebula and leaving a hot and dense O/Ne/Mg core behind (white dwarf) High-mass Stars In high-mass stars, carbon burning goes so fast that the envelope does not have time to repond, and we do not see much signs of carbon burning. Neon Burning For high-mass stars, the O/Ne/Mg core contracts and heats up (again) until it reaches around 1.5 billion K, with a density of approximately \\(10^9 kg/m^3\\) Neon Burning will make Oxygen and Magnesium nuclei, which creates an inert O/Mg core. Neon Burning is incredibly inefficient, with a large amount of energy radiated away as neutrinoes, causing reaction rates to go even higher. At such high temperatures, high-energy photons can disintegrate a fraction of Neon Nuclei, causing there to be even less Neon nuclei to support the star's gravity. Warning This stage lasts (approximately) a few years only. Oxygen Burning The O/Mg core contracts and heats up (yet again) until it reaches somewhere around 2 billion K with a density of very approximately \\(10^{12} kg/m^3\\) (and it's still a gas somehow) Wait why is it Neon Burning before Oxygen? Even though Oxygen-16 is lighter than Neon, Oxygen is magical ( doubly-magic ) and hence extremely stable. And this Neon is less stable and fuses at lower temperatures. Neutrino losses from Oxygen burning are also significant, such that oxygen must burn at temperatures higher than a billion kelvins in order to maintain a radiation pressure strong enough to support the star against gravity. Warning This stage lasts (very approximately) a year only. Oxygen can fuse together to form Silicon, Phosphorus, Sulfur, Chlorine, Argon, Potassium and Calcium. (Mostly Silicon and Sulfur) This creates an inert Silicon (among other things) core. Silicon Burning (guys I swear this is the last one) The Silicon core contracts and heats up (come on not again) until it reaches somewhere around 3 Billion Kelvin and Silicon burning starts. Photodisintegration (where light breaks apart nuclei) removes like half the available silicon nuclei and decomposes it into a soup of Helium, protons and neutrons. The remaining Silicon nuclei fuse with the disintegrated Helium until it reaches Nickel-56 (process known as the alpha ladder or alpha process ), which decays into Iron-56. And no more fusion can happen from here due to Iron being at the peak of the nuclear binding energy chart. But isn't Nickel-62 most stable nucleus, not Iron-56? Yes, in fact \\(^{56}\\text{Fe} + \\!^4\\text{He} \\rightarrow \\,^{60}\\text{Ni}\\) is exothermic. But photodisintegration is also a factor here, and it turns out that the rate of photodisintegration is faster than the alpha process for that step. Hence \\(^{56}\\text{Ni}\\) is produced more than \\(^{62}\\text{Ni}\\) This builds up an inert Nickel/Iron core. Around which has a Si-burning shell, around it has a O-burning shell, around it has a Ne-burning shell, around it has a C-burning shell, around it has a He-burning shell, and around it has a H-burning shell, like an onion. Warning This process lasts like a day The iron core reaches a mass of around \\(1\\) to \\(2M_\\odot\\) , and contracts and heat up (for the last time). Iron core collapse Here is where things go badly for the star. There are photons that are so high energy that they disintegrate the nuclei (photodisintegration). However, the only things that were supporting up the star was photons via radiation pressure, so the star gets robbed of its energy. Free protons and electrons fuse into a neutron and a neutrino, however the neutrino does not contribute to radiation pressure, so this takes energy away from the core. Eventually radiation pressure caves to gravity and the core collapses . Catastrophically .

It becomes inert (unable to \"react\" via nuclear processes, i.e. fusion). Fusion stops entirely . There is no longer any pressure support, so gravity pulls outer layers inwards, which causes the core to contract and heat up until the area around the core heats up enough to start fusing hydrogen, creating a shell of hydrogen fusion. (this shell lasts 1 billion years for the sun) structure of a subgiant. Red Giant Branch (RGB) Due to the increased temperature, the hydrogen fusion rate (in the shell) is faster and radiation pressure is higher. This actually causes the outer layers of the star to expand to maintain the pressure gradient. Due to decreased pressure and increase surface area this causes the surface temperature to drop and for it to turn red. It will expand out to the orbit of Venus so there planets will be gone. The outer envelope is so extended that it is only weakly held by gravitational force to the rest of the star and easily ejected. However the contracted helium core is incredibly dense. It is only about one-third its original size. During this time the sun loses about a quarter of it's total mass in a strong stellar wind. The mass lost is from the outer envelope and not the core. The core contraction and envelope expansion is very rapid, taking only a few million years. In this time the temperature of the star will cool from its main sequence value of 6000 \u2013 30000 K to around 5000 K. Hence there are very few stars in that area in the HR diagram which is know as the Hertzsprung gap. Hertzsprung Gap Helium Flash Hydrogen fusion in the shell produces more helium. This gets dumped onto the core, adding to its mass, causing it to heat up even more. When the core temperature reaches 100 million K , the helium nuclei now have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome their strong repulsion and fuse together, forming carbon-12 in the triple-alpha process Once the temperature is hot enough helium fusion begins in a matter of minutes or hours. This sudden onset of helium core fusion (or \"burning\") is called the helium flash . Extension For stars greater \\(>2.5M_\\bigodot\\) , there is no helium flash , instead it begins burning gradually. We will touch on this later. Lower-mass stars do not produce enough gravitational pressure to initiate normal helium fusion. As the hydrogen in the core is exhausted, some of the helium left behind is instead compacted into degenerate matter (matter so dense that quantum effects are significant). The particles get packed down so densely its almost like they don't have a temperature. They almost get to the point where the particles are stacked like bricks, so the electrons are almost incapable of moving (The nuclei can still wiggle). The core is supported against gravitational collapse by quantum mechanical pressure rather than thermal pressure. This increases the density and temperature of the core until it reaches approximately 100 million kelvin, which is hot enough to cause helium fusion. However, a fundamental quality of degenerate matter is that increases in temperature do not produce an increase in volume of the matter until the thermal pressure becomes high enough to exceed degeneracy pressure (quantum mechanical pressure, which is really high). In this case, the helium fusion increases the temperature, which increases the fusion rate, which further increases the temperature in a runaway reaction. This produces a flash of very intense helium fusion that lasts only a few minutes, but briefly emits energy at a rate comparable to the entire Milky Way galaxy. In the case of normal low-mass stars, the enormous energy release causes the core to come out of degeneracy, allowing it to expand (because of the insane thermal energy), and any left-over energy is absorbed into the star's upper layers. Thus the helium flash is mostly undetectable to observation . Red clump / Horizontal Branch (HB) The energy released from the helium flash allows the core to cool and expand, and also expands the hydrogen-burning shell further out in the star. The expansion of the hydrogen-burning shell reduces its temperature, density, and hence its energy generation and radiation pressure. In some mass ranges, hydrogen fusion ceases. The outer hydrogen-rich envelope of the star reacts to this temperature decrease by contracting. Since \\(L=4\\pi R^2\\sigma T^4\\) , the contraction would lead to an increase in the effective surface temperature if the luminosity was constant. However, the luminosity of the star is also lower, so the increase in temperature is less pronounced. The star\u2019s new stable location is slightly down and slightly towards the left of the giant branch. Because the new configuration of stable core-helium burning and shell-hydrogen burning is reasonably long lived, stars remain in this region of the H\u2013R diagram for some time. The location is recognized observationally as a clump of stars in the H\u2013R diagram, due to the slow evolution through this phase of life, and they are called red-giant clump stars . H\u2013R diagram of the H 4 star cluster showing a populated main sequence and a red-giant branch with distinct core-helium burning red-giant clump stars. $m_v$ is absolute magnitude and $B-V$ is a color index For stars with lower metal (anything heavier than helium) content, they have higher temperatures so their location in the H\u2013R diagram is called the horizontal branch . This is basically the \"helium main sequence\" Structure of a star on the red clump/horizontal branch H\u2013R diagrams of the globular cluster M3, showing the horizontal branch (HB) which are populated by core-helium burning stars with a low metal content. These clusters have ages around $13\\times10^9$ years, and their metal content is only $\\approx\\frac{1}{30}$ of the solar value. $V-I$ is a color index. Our sun has sufficient helium fuel for this stage to last for about 100 million years fun fact: more stars less massive than \\(2M_\\odot~2.5M_\\odot\\) , the helium cores have the same mass when helium fusion starts, regardless of total solar mass. So the helium fusion luminosity on the horizontal branch is the same (Hydrogen shell fusion causes total luminosity to vary, but for most stars they are very similar) Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) Eventually all the helium in the core has fused into carbon and oxygen and so the core becomes inert again and contracts. Carbon and oxygen nuclei have more protons in them than helium does so the repulsion is greater, and require higher temperature and pressure. (Carbon burning, the next available fusion process, occurs at 500-900 million K and at densities of \\(3 \\times 10^9 kg/m^3\\) ). Stars less than 8 times the mass of our sun can't reach those temperatures and densities. The core contraction does however generate sufficient heat for the surrounding layer of helium to start fusing, that is helium shell burning starts. Energy from the helium-burning in turn heats up surrounding unused hydrogen which also starts shell burning. This is basically the RGB all over again, and for the same reason the star expands to a red giant (again) Structure of an AGB star If the helium fuel in the He-burning shell runs low, the outward radiation pressure drops off. As this was previously holding out the shell of hydrogen gas, this shell now contracts, heats up enough to ignite and start fusion, converting hydrogen to helium. This helium \"ash\" in turn falls onto the helium shell, heating it up until the helium shell is hot enough to re-ignite in a helium-shell flash, producing a thermal pulse . Increased radiation pressure now causes the hydrogen shell to expand and cool, shutting down H-shell fusion. Over time the frequency of thermal pulses increases. During a thermal pulse nuclei within the helium-burning shell can be synthesised into heavier nuclei (up to Bismuth) through the capture of neutrons and radioactive beta decay (s-process) Large convection currents in AGB stars carry material produced in the thin helium-burning shell up to the surface which are ejected, which contains heavier elements. Note Helium Fusion is extremely sensitive to temperature. (proportional to something like \\(T^{40}\\) ). If T at 100 million K increases by 10%, fusion rate increases 45x As a consequence of this, a small change in temperature can lead to enormous change in fusion energy output. AGB Stars experience huge thermal pulses that destabilize the outer envelope. Due to these thermal pulses, the outer envelope gets ejected as a fast wind (this only takes 100,000 years). The C-O core continues to contract, but the wind takes the weight of the envelope off, so the core doesn't heat up as much, and never reaches the 600 million K required to carbon fusion. The continued thermal pulses results in the envelope separating from the core. This reduces the Sun's mass to about 60% of the original mass Post-AGB The last of the thermal pulses blows away what is left of the envelope (over about a few thousand years). As the last of the envelope comes off, the hot C-O core of the Sun is unveiled. The temperature goes from 4000K (envelope) to 120000K (bare core). The luminosity stays constant. This is represented on the HR diagram as it moving horizontally towards the left side. Planetary Nebulae Once the outer layers of the star are ejected the core is left exposed. It is hot enough to emit ultraviolet light to ionize the ejected material, which causes the cloud to glow. This creates a planetary nebula which unfortunately only lasts for about 10,000-20,000 years before dispersing into interstellar medium. White dwarf The contracting C-O core becomes so dense that a new gas law takes over - a degenerate electron gas. The pressure becomes independent of the temperature, so the pressure grows rapidly and counterracts gravity. The collapse stops at \\(0.01R_\\bigodot\\) which is around the size of Earth. The degenerate core becomes a white dwarf. It has a mass of around \\(0.54M_\\bigodot\\) . It now begins a long, slow cooling phase that will last for maybe a trillion years as it slowly fades away.
